# Interior-design-app
My project is called “Interior Design Challenge” and is an interactive room-designing game. The user is assigned a client who gives them a theme to follow in making them a room. The user chooses furniture, staying under a budget, and is scored based on how well they followed their client’s request. Then an AI backtracking algorithm creates the room that maximizes the scoring algorithm, which scores based on things like furniture chosen and placement of furniture. 


To run the project, you need the main file, cmu_graphics_112, a file with the client class, and a file with the furniture class. All images are taken from online, so no images need to be downloaded.


No libraries are required.


No shortcut commands exist.
